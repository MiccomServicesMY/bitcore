Bitcore
=======

This is SatoshiLabs fork of Bitpay's Bitcore that uses Bitcoin 0.15.0. It has a limited segwit support. We also have separate branches for some Bitcoin forks (UASF, 2x, Gold, Cash).

We (SatoshiLabs) are not promising to keep these forks "alive", updated and maintained, long-term. For that reason, they are not pushed into NPM, just on github.

However, right now, we are actively using these in production on https://wallet.trezor.io .

What is also added is support for new smart fees; `/utils/estimatesmartfee?nbBlocks=2&mode=economical` returns the new smart fees. Similarly, estimatesmartfee (with `int bool` parameters) is added to the bitcore websocket API.

We do not version Bitcore here, either for mainnet or for the forks; we are using https://github.com/satoshilabs/bitcore-deb to build debian packages, which are versioned, for all the coins. So this repo might seem a little chaotic, but we are pinning commit hashes for various altcoins in the bitcore-deb repo.

Bitpay's Bitcore has diverged from our code with their recent rewrites and refactors (for example, added bcoin for transaction parsing); we do not plan to merge the big refactors back here. (see https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore )

Following is original Bitcore readme.

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/bitpay/bitcore.svg?branch=master&style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/bitpay/bitcore)

Infrastructure to build Bitcoin and blockchain-based applications for the next generation of financial technology.

**Note:** If you're looking for the Bitcore Library please see: https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-lib

## Getting Started

Before you begin you'll need to have Node.js v4 or v0.12 installed. There are several options for installation. One method is to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily switch between different versions, or download directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
npm install -g bitcore
```

Spin up a full node and join the network:

```bash
npm install -g bitcore
bitcored
```

You can then view the Insight block explorer at the default location: `http://localhost:3001/insight`, and your configuration file will be found in your home directory at `~/.bitcore`.

Create a transaction:
```js
var bitcore = require('bitcore');
var transaction = new bitcore.Transaction();
var transaction.from(unspent).to(address, amount);
transaction.sign(privateKey);
```
